Statistical_Models_Central_Limit_Theorem
=========================================
Load the Facebook edges file into R.
Write Production level R-code that computes the mean degree of the graph and shows a plot of the histogram of the degrees. 
Verify your answers in Gephi.
Write R code that performs a K-S test for the two hypotheses:
Test if the distribution of degrees is Poisson. (reuse K-S code) Just report the k-s distance from our code.
Test if the distribution of degrees is a Power Law. (Use igraph library)
